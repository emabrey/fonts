    Inconsolata is a monospace font  designed with attention to detail for high resolution rendering for printed code listings and other similar usages. Additionally, Inconsolata was Raph Levien's first serious original font release.

    Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. Levien was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, the monospace font designed for Microsoft's Vista release.
    Consolas (similar to Groot's earlier font TheSansMono) demonstrated clearly to Levien that monospace fonts don't have to suck. As a result of that demonstration he eventually went on to design Inconsolata.

    The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge. The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.
